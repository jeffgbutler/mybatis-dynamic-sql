# Change Log

This log will detail notable changes to MyBatis Dynamic SQL. Full details are available on the GitHub milestone pages.

## Release 1.5.0 - Unreleased

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/milestone/12](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/milestone/12)

Added:

1. Added support for specifying "limit" and "order by" on the DELETE and UPDATE statements. Not all databases support
   this SQL extension, and different databases have different levels of support. For example, MySQL/MariaDB have full
   support but HSQLDB only supports limit as an extension to the WHERE clause. If you choose to use this new capability,
   please test to make sure it is supported in your database. ([#544](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/544))


## Release 1.4.1 - October 7, 2022

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.1+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.1+)

### Potentially Breaking Change

In this release we have changed the default behavior of the library in one key area. If a where clause is coded,
but fails to render because all the optional conditionals drop out of the where clause, then the library will now
throw a `NonRenderingWhereClauseException`. We have made this change out of an abundance of caution. The prior
behavior would allow generation of statements that inadvertently affected all rows in a table.

We have also deprecated the "empty callback" functions in the "in" conditions in favor of this new configuration
strategy. The "empty callback" methods were effective for "in" conditions that failed to render, but they offered
no help for other conditions that failed to render, or if all conditions fail to render - which is arguably a more
dangerous outcome. If you were using any of these methods, you should remove the calls to those methods and catch the
new `NonRenderingWhereClauseException`.

If you desire the prior behavior where non rendering where clauses are allowed, you can change the global configuration
of the library or - even better - change the configuration of individual statements where this behavior should be allowed.

For examples of global and statement configuration, see the "Configuration of the Library" page.

### Other Changes

1. Added support for criteria groups without an initial criteria. This makes it possible to create an independent list
   of pre-created criteria and then add the list to a where clause. See the tests in the related pull request for
   usage examples. ([#462](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/462))
2. Added the ability to specify a table alias on DELETE and UPDATE statements.
   This is especially useful when working with a sub-query with an exists or not exists condition.
   ([#489](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/489))
3. Updated the Kotlin DSL to use Kotlin 1.7's new "definitely non-null" types where appropriate. This helps us to more
   accurately represent the nullable/non-nullable expectations for API method calls.
   ([#496](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/496))
4. Added the ability to configure the library and change some default behaviors. Currently, this is limited to changing
   the behavior of the library in regard to where clauses that will not render. See the "Configuration of the Library"
   page for details. ([#515](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/515))
5. Added several checks for invalid SQL ([#516](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/516))
6. Added documentation for the various exceptions thrown by the library ([#517](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/517))
7. Update the "insertSelect" method in the Kotlin DSL to make it consistent with the other insert methods ([#524](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/524))

## Release 1.4.0 - March 3, 2022

The release includes new functionality in the Where Clause DSL to support arbitrary grouping of conditions, and also use
of a "not" condition. It should now be possible to write any type of where clause.

Additionally, there were significant updates to the Kotlin DSL - both to support the new functionality in the
where clause, and significant updates to insert statements. There were also many minor updates in Kotlin
to make more use of Kotlin language features like infix functions and operator overloads.

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0+)

1. Added support for arbitrary placement of nested criteria. For example, it is now
   possible to write a where clause like this: `where (a < 5 and B = 3) and ((C = 4 or D = 5) and E = 6)`. Previously
   we did not support the grouping of criteria at the beginning of a where clause or the beginning of an and/or
   condition. Adding this support required significant refactoring, but that should be transparent to most users.
   ([#434](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/434))
2. Remove deprecated "when" and "then" methods on all conditions. The methods have been replaced by more appropriately
   named "filter" and "map" methods that function as expected for method chaining.
   ([#435](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/435))
3. Added support for a "not" criteria grouping on a where clause. It is now possible to write a where clause like
   `where (a < 5 and B = 3) and (not (C = 4 or D = 5) and E = 6)`. With this enhancement (and the enhancement for
   arbitrary grouping) it should now be possible to write virtually any where clause imaginable.
   ([#438](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/438))
4. Major update to the Kotlin where clause DSL. Where clauses now support the "group" and "not" features from above. In
   addition, the where clause DSL has been fully updated to make it feel more like natural SQL. The previous version
   of the where clause DSL would have yielded almost unreadable code had the "group" and "not" functions been added.
   This update is better all around and yields a DSL that is very similar to native SQL. The new DSL includes many
   Kotlin DSL construction features including infix functions, operator overloads, and functions with receivers.
   We believe it will be well worth the effort to migrate to the new DSL. The prior where clause DSL remains in the
   library for now, but is deprecated. It will be removed in version 1.5.0 of the library. Documentation for the new
   DSL is here: https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/blob/master/src/site/markdown/docs/kotlinWhereClauses.md
   ([#442](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/442))
5. General cleanup of the Kotlin DSL. The Kotlin DSL functions are now mostly Unit functions. This should have
   no impact on most users and is source code compatible with prior versions of the library when the library was used
   as described in the documentation. This change greatly simplifies the type hierarchy of the Kotlin builders.
   ([#446](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/446))
6. Minor update the Kotlin join DSL to make it closer to natural SQL. The existing join methods are deprecated and
   will be removed in version 1.5.0. ([#447](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/447))
7. Updated most of the Kotlin insert DSL functions to be more like natural SQL. The main difference is that for insert,
   insertBatch, and insertMultiple, the "into" function is moved inside the completer lambda. The old methods are now
   deprecated and will be removed in version 1.5.0 of the library. This also allowed us to make some insert DSL
   methods into infix functions. ([#452](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/452))
8. Updated the where clause to expose table aliases specified in an outer query to sub queries in the where clause
   (either an "exists" clause, or a sub query to column comparison condition) This makes it easier to use these types
   of sub queries without having to re-specify the aliases for columns from the outer query.
   ([#459](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/459))

## Release 1.3.1 - December 18, 2021

This is a minor release with a few small enhancements. Most deprecated methods will be removed in the next release.

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.1+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.1+)

### Added

- Added the ability to specify a JavaType associated with a column. The JavaType will be rendered properly for MyBatis ([#386](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/386))
- Added a few missing groupBy and orderBy methods on the `select` statement ([#409](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/409))
- Added a check for when a table alias is re-used in error (typically in a self-join) ([#425](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/425))
- Added a new extension of SqlTable that supports setting a table alias directly within the table definition ([#426](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/426))

## Release 1.3.0 - May 6, 2021

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.0+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.0+)

### Release Themes

The major themes of this release include the following:

1. Add support for subqueries in select statements - both in a from clause and a join clause.
1. Add support for the "exists" and "not exists" operator. This will work in "where" clauses anywhere
   they are supported.
1. Refactor and improve the built-in conditions for consistency (see below). There is one breaking change also
   detailed below.
1. Continue to refine the Kotlin DSL. Many changes to the Kotlin DSL are internal and should be source code
   compatible with existing code. There is one breaking change detailed below.
1. Remove deprecated code from prior releases.

### Built-In Condition Refactoring and Breaking Change
All built-in conditions have been refactored. The changes should have little impact for the vast majority of users.
However, there are some changes in behavior and one breaking change.

1. Internally, the conditions no longer hold value Suppliers, they now hold the values themselves. The SqlBuilder
   methods that accept Suppliers will call the `Supplier.get()` method when the condition is constructed. This should
   have no impact unless you were somehow relying on the delay in obtaining a value until the condition was rendered.
1. The existing "then" and "when" methods have been deprecated and replaced with "map" and "filter" respectively.
   The new method names are more familiar and more representative of what these methods actually do. In effect
   these methods mimic the function of the "map" and "filter" methods on "java.util.Optional" and they are used
   for a similar purpose.
1. The new "filter" method works a bit differently than the "when" method it replaces. The old "when" method could not
   be chained - if it was called multiple times, only the last call would take effect. The new "filter" methods works
   as it should and every call will take effect. This allows you to construct map/filter pipelines as you would
   expect.
1. The new "map" method will allow you to change the datatype of a condition as is normal for a "map" method. You
   can use this method to apply a type conversion directly within condition.
1. All the "WhenPresent" conditions have been removed as separate classes. The methods that produced these conditions
   in the SqlBuilder remain, and they will now produce a condition with a "NotNull" filter applied. So at the API level
   things will function exactly as before, but the intermediate classes will be different.
1. One **breaking change** is that the builder for List value conditions has been removed without replacement. If you
   were using this builder to supply a "value stream transformer", then the replacement is to build a new List value
   condition and then call the "map" and "filter" methods as needed. For example, prior code looked like this

   ```java
    public static IsIn<String> isIn(String...values) {
        return new IsIn.Builder<String>()
                .withValues(Arrays.asList(values))
                .withValueStreamTransformer(s -> s.filter(Objects::nonNull)
                        .map(String::trim)
                        .filter(st -> !st.isEmpty()))
                .build();
    }
   ```
   New code should look like this:
   ```java
    public static IsIn<String> isIn(String...values) {
        return SqlBuilder.isIn(values)
                .filter(Objects::nonNull)
                .map(String::trim)
                .filter(st -> !st.isEmpty());
    }
   ```
   We think this is a marked improvement!

### Kotlin DSL Update and Breaking Change for Kotlin

The Kotlin DSL continues to evolve. With this release we have fully built out the DSL, and it is no longer necessary
to use any functions in `org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.SqlBuilder`. The advantages of this are many and are detailed on the
Kotlin overview page in the documentation. Many functions in `SqlBuilder` have been replaced by
top level functions the `org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.util.kotlin.elements` package. In most cases you can switch to the
native Kotlin DSL by simply changing the import statements. For example, you can switch usage of the `isEqualTo`
function by changing

```kotlin
import org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.SqlBuilder.isEqualTo
```

to

```kotlin
import org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.util.kotlin.elements.isEqualTo
```

Several functions that accepted supplier arguments are not present in the Kotlin DSL. This is to avoid difficult
and confusing method overload problems for methods that did not offer any real benefit. If you were using one of these
methods in the Java DSL, then in the Kotlin DSL you will have to change the function argument from a supplier to the
actual value itself. 

A **breaking change** is that Kotlin support for `select` and `count` statements has been refactored. This will not impact code
created by MyBatis generator. It will have an impact on Spring/Kotlin users as well as MyBatis users that coded joins or
other queries directly in Kotlin. The difference is that the `from` clause has been moved inside the lambda for select
and count statements.

Previously, code looked like this:
```kotlin
   val selectStatement = select(foo).from(bar) {
       where(id, isLessThan(3))
   }
```
  
The new code looks like this:
```kotlin
   val selectStatement = select(foo) {
       from(bar)
       where(id, isLessThan(3))
   }
```
  
This change makes the Kotlin DSL more consistent and also makes it easier to implement subquery support in the
Kotlin DSL.

### Added

- Added a new sort specification that is useful in selects with joins ([#269](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/269))
- Added the capability to generate a camel cased alias for a column ([#272](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/272))
- Added subquery support for "from" clauses in a select statement ([#282](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/282))
- Added Kotlin DSL updates to support sub-queries in select statements, where clauses, and insert statements ([#282](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/282))
- Added subquery support for "join" clauses in a select statement ([#293](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/293))
- Added support for the "exists" and "not exists" operator in where clauses ([#296](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/296))
- Refactored the built-in conditions ([#331](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/331)) ([#336](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/336))
- Added composition functions for WhereApplier ([#335](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/335))
- Added a mapping for general insert and update statements that will render null values as "null" in the SQL ([#343](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/343))
- Allow the "in when present" conditions to accept a null Collection as a parameter ([#346](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/346))
- Add Better Support for MyBatis Multi-Row Inserts that Return Generated Keys ([#349](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/349))
- Major improvement to the Kotlin DSL ([#353](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/353))
- Remove use of "record" as an identifier (it is restricted in JDK16) ([#357](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/357))

## Release 1.2.1 - September 29, 2020

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.1+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.1+)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the In conditions could render incorrectly in certain circumstances. ([#239](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/239))

### Added

- Added a callback capability to the "In" conditions that will be called before rendering when the conditions are empty. Also, removed the option that forced the library to render invalid SQL in that case. ([#241](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/241))
- Added a utility mapper for MyBatis that allows you to run any select query without having to predefine a result mapping. ([#255](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/255))
- Added utility mappers for MyBatis that allow you to run generic CRUD operations. ([#263](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/263))

## Release 1.2.0 - August 19, 2020

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0+)

### General Announcements

This release includes major improvements to the Spring support in the library. Spring support is now functionally equivalent to MyBatis support.

This release includes a significant refactoring of the classes in the "org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.select.function" package. The new classes are more consistent and flexible and should be compatible with existing code at the source level (meaning code should be recompiled for the new version of the library). If you have written your own set of functions to extend the library, you will notice that the base classes 'AbstractFunction" and "AbstractMultipleColumnArithmeticFunction" are now deprecated. Their replacement classes are "AbstractUniTypeFunction" and "OperatorFunction" respectively.

With this release, we deprecated several insert methods because they were inconsistently named or awkward. All deprecated methods have documented direct replacements.

All deprecated code will be removed in the next minor release.

### Added

- Added a general insert statement that does not require a separate record class to hold values for the insert. ([#201](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/201))
- Added the capability to specify a rendering strategy on a column to override the default rendering strategy for a statement. This will allow certain edge cases where a parameter marker needs to be formatted uniquely (for example, "::jsonb" needs to be added to parameter markers for JSON fields in PostgreSQL) ([#200](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/200))
- Added the ability to write a function that will change the column data type ([#197](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/197))
- Added the `applyOperator` function to make it easy to use non-standard database operators in expressions ([#220](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/220))
- Added convenience methods for count(column) and count(distinct column) ([#221](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/221))
- Added support for union queries in Kotlin ([#187](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/187))
- Added the ability to write "in" conditions that will render even if empty ([#228](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/228))
- Many enhancements for Spring including:
  - Fixed a bug where multi-row insert statements did not render properly for Spring ([#224](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/224))
  - Added support for a parameter type converter for use cases where the Java type of a column does not match the database column type ([#131](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/131))
  - Added a utility class which simplifies the use of the named parameter JDBC template for Java code - `org.mybatis.dynamic.sql.util.spring.NamedParameterJdbcTemplateExtensions`
  - Added support for general inserts, multi-row inserts, batch inserts in the Kotlin DSL for Spring ([#225](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/225))
  - Added support for generated keys in the Kotlin DSL for Spring ([#226](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/226))

## Release 1.1.4 - November 23, 2019

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.4+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.4+)

### Added

- Added support for reusing WHERE clauses among count, delete, select, and update statements ([#152](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/152))
- Improved Kotlin support. Previously, several overloaded methods could collide causing queries to be fragile and very dependent on having the correct imports in a Kotlin file. With this improved support there is no longer any ambiguity. ([#154](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/154))

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue where limit and offset in sub-queries could cause a parameter name collision ([#142](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/142))

## Release 1.1.3 - September 16, 2019

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.3+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.3+)

### Added

- Added support for `count(distinct ...)` ([#112](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/112))
- Added support for multiple row inserts ([#116](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/116))
- Utility classes and a new canonical pattern for MyBatis Generator (CRUD) mappers ([#118](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/118)) ([#125](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/125)) ([#128](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/128))
- Kotlin Extensions and Kotlin DSL ([#133](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/133)) ([#139](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/139))

## Release 1.1.2 - July 5, 2019

GitHub milestone: [https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.2+](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.2+)

### Added

- Changed the public SQLBuilder API to accept Collection instead of List for in conditions and batch record inserts. This should have no impact on existing code, but allow for some future flexibility ([#88](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/88))
- Added the ability to have table catalog and/or schema calculated at runtime. This is useful for situations where there are different database schemas for different environments, or in some sharding situations ([#92](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/92))
- Add support for paging queries with "offset" and "fetch first" - this seems to be standard on most databases ([#96](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/96))
- Added the ability to call a builder method on any intermediate object in a select statement and receive a fully rendered statement. This makes it easier to build very dynamic queries ([#106](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/pull/106))
- Add the ability to modify values on any condition before they are placed in the parameter map ([#105](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/105))
- Add the ability to call `where()` with no parameters. This aids in constructing very dynamic queries ([#107](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/issues/107))
