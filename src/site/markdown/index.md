# MyBatis Dynamic SQL
MyBatis Dynamic SQL is an SQL DSL (domain specific language). It allows developers to write SQL in Java or Kotlin using the natural feel of native SQL. It also
includes many functions for creating very dynamic SQL statements based on current runtime parameter values.

The DSL will render standard SQL DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements - and associated
parameters - that can be used directly by SQL execution engines like MyBatis or Spring JDBC template.

Please read the user's guide for detailed instructions on use.  The user's guide is accessible through menu links to the left.

The best examples of usage are the unit tests in the [src\test\java](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-dynamic-sql/tree/master/src/test/java) directory in the source repository.  They cover all aspects of using the library.
