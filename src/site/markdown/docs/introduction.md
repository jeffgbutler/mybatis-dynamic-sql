# MyBatis Dynamic SQL

This library is a framework for generating dynamic SQL statements.  Think of it as a typesafe SQL templating library,
with additional support for MyBatis3 and Spring JDBC Templates.

The library will generate full DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements formatted for use by MyBatis or Spring.
The most common use case is to generate statements, and a matching set of parameters, that can be directly used
by MyBatis.  The library will also generate statements and parameter objects that are compatible with Spring JDBC
templates.

The library works by implementing an SQL-like DSL that creates an object containing a full SQL statement and any
parameters required for that statement.  The SQL statement object can be used directly by MyBatis as a parameter to a mapper method.

The library will generate these types of SQL statements:

- COUNT statements - specialized SELECT statements that return a Long value
- DELETE statements with flexible WHERE clauses
- INSERT statements of several types:
    - A statement that inserts a single row with values supplied from a corresponding Object
    - A statement that inserts a single row with values supplied directly in the statement
    - A statement that inserts multiple rows using multiple VALUES clauses
    - A statement that inserts multiple rows using a JDBC batch
    - A statement that inserts into a table using the results of a SELECT statement
- SELECT statements with a flexible column list, a flexible WHERE clause, and support for distinct, "group by", joins, unions, "order by", etc.
- UPDATE statements with a flexible WHERE clause, and flexible SET clauses

The primary goals of the library are:

1. Typesafe - to the extent possible, the library will ensure that parameter types match
   the database column types
2. Expressive - statements are built in a way that clearly communicates their meaning
   (thanks to Hamcrest for some inspiration)
3. Flexible - where clauses can be built using any combination of and, or, and nested conditions
4. Extensible - the library will render statements for MyBatis3, Spring JDBC templates or plain JDBC.
   It can be extended to  generate clauses for other frameworks as well.  Custom where conditions can
   be added easily if none of the built in conditions are sufficient for your needs.
5. Small - the library is a small dependency to add.  It has no transitive dependencies.

This library grew out of a desire to create a utility that could be used to improve the code
generated by MyBatis Generator, but the library can be used on its own with very little setup required.
